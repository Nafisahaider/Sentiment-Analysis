# Sentiment-Analysis
Sentiment Analysis using TF-IDF and Logistic Regression
This project demonstrates a basic implementation of sentiment analysis using TF-IDF vectorization and Logistic Regression. It includes text preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Features

Text data preprocessing

Conversion of text to numerical features using TF-IDF

Classification using Logistic Regression

Model evaluation with metrics like confusion matrix and classification report

Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn nltk

## Files

NLP.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation.

## Implementation Steps

### Data Preprocessing:

Import and clean text data.

Remove stopwords using the nltk library.

### Feature Extraction:

Convert the cleaned text into numerical format using TfidfVectorizer from scikit-learn.

### Model Training:

Use LogisticRegression for binary or multi-class classification.

### Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

### Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

### Visualization:

Use matplotlib and seaborn for visualizing data and results.

## How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone <repository-url>

Navigate to the project directory:

cd sentiment-analysis

Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook NLP.ipynb

Run the cells in the notebook to execute the code step by step.

## Dependencies

The project uses the following libraries:

pandas for data manipulation

numpy for numerical computations

scikit-learn for feature extraction and modeling

matplotlib and seaborn for visualization

nltk for natural language processing

## Results

The project outputs:

A trained Logistic Regression model

Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix

Visualizations of data and model performance
